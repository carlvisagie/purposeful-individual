## 📖 EXAMPLE SESSION

**Client:** "My son won't sleep. We've tried everything."

**Co-Pilot Whispers:**

```
💡 CONTEXT: Last session 12 days ago. Discussed sleep hygiene.
Current goal: 6+ hours continuous sleep. Alert: Son's birthday in 3 days.

🔍 MULTI-LAYER ANALYSIS INITIATED...

📊 PATTERN: Matches "Stressed Parent Sleep Cascade" (Pattern #7, n=47)
- 89% have unaddressed parent stress
- 76% improve with parent-first approach

🎯 HABIT FRAMEWORK:
- HEART: Voice pitch elevated +15% (stress)
- ADAPTORS: Rubbing neck (anxiety)
- BARRIERS: Arms crossed (defensive about work)
- ILLUSTRATORS: Minimal gestures (cognitive overload)
- TIMING: Long pauses about finances (hiding truth)

🔮 PREDICTION (82% confidence):
- Parent likely exhausted/depressed
- Relationship strain probable
- Financial stress possible

🕸️ SYSTEM MAP:
Parent stress (L4) → Inconsistent routine (L3) → 
Child anxiety (L2) → Sleep resistance (L1)

💬 SOCRATIC: Ask "What's YOUR sleep like?" 
(leads to parent stress discovery)
```

**Coach:** "I hear you. Before we talk about your son, how is YOUR sleep?"

**Client:** "Terrible. I'm up worrying about money, my marriage is struggling..."

**Co-Pilot Whispers:**

```
✅ EXCELLENT! Root cause emerging (financial + relationship stress)

🔍 CAUSAL CHAIN CONFIRMED:
L5: Financial pressure
L4: Marriage stress  
L3: Parent sleep deprivation
L2: Inconsistent parenting
L1: Child sleep issues

🧬 NEUROSCIENCE (Huberman):
- Parent: HPA axis dysregulation (chronic stress)
- Child: Mirror neurons picking up parent's stress
- Both: Dopamine depletion → anhedonia

😴 SLEEP (Walker):
- Parent: Sleep debt → emotional dysregulation
- Child: Circadian disruption from inconsistent routine

🧘 POLYVAGAL (Porges):
- Parent stuck in sympathetic (fight/flight)
- Child's neuroception detecting danger
- Co-dysregulation loop

📖 MANDINO: "Master my emotions" - Parent needs 
emotional regulation FIRST

📈 EVIDENCE-BASED RECOMMENDATION:

For PARENT (address first):
- Magnesium glycinate 400mg ████████░░ 8/10
- Huberman stress protocol ████████░░ 8/10  
- Couples counseling referral ███████░░░ 7/10
- Financial counseling referral ██████░░░░ 6/10

💬 SOCRATIC: "What would happen if YOU slept better 
and felt less stressed? How might that affect your son?"
```
