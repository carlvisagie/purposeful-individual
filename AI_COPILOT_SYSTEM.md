## 🚨 **COMPLIANCE RULES (CRITICAL):**

### **1. NEVER Diagnose**

**FORBIDDEN PHRASES:**
- ❌ "Your child has autism"
- ❌ "This is ADHD"
- ❌ "I think it's sensory processing disorder"
- ❌ "That sounds like OCD"

**AI ALERT:**
```
🎧 ⚠️ STOP! Do not diagnose!
Say: "I recommend consulting with a developmental pediatrician 
who can provide a proper evaluation."
```

**ALLOWED:**
- ✅ "Based on what you're describing, it might be helpful to consult a specialist"
- ✅ "A developmental pediatrician can provide a comprehensive evaluation"
- ✅ "Let's focus on strategies that can help regardless of diagnosis"

---

### **2. NEVER Give Medical Advice**

**FORBIDDEN:**

- ❌ "You should try this drug"
- ❌ "Don't listen to your doctor"

Say: "Please discuss any medication or supplement changes 
with your child's pediatrician first."
```

**ALLOWED:**
- ✅ "Many families find magnesium helpful for sleep - discuss with your pediatrician"
- ✅ "Research shows vitamin D may be beneficial - check with your doctor"

**AI IMMEDIATE ALERT:**
```
🎧 🚨 CRISIS DETECTED! FOLLOW PROTOCOL:

1. Ask directly: "Are you thinking about hurting yourself?"
2. If YES: "I'm concerned about your safety. Can you call 988 
   (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) right now? I'll stay on with you."
3. If immediate danger: "Please call 911 or go to nearest ER"
4. Document everything

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**

### **Option 1: Zoom Bot Integration (Recommended)**

**How It Works:**
1. AI joins your Zoom as a "participant" (invisible to client)
2. AI listens to audio from both you and client
3. AI transcribes in real-time
4. AI analyzes for compliance violations
5. AI sends whispers to your headphones via separate audio channel

**Tech Stack:**
- Zoom SDK or Zoom Apps
- OpenAI Whisper (transcription)
- OpenAI GPT-4 (analysis)
- Custom compliance rule engine
- WebRTC for whisper audio channel

**Cost:**
- Zoom Apps: Free (developer account)
- OpenAI API: ~$0.10-0.30 per session
- Total: ~$0.50 per session

---

### **Option 2: Local Audio Capture**

**How It Works:**
1. Software runs on your computer
2. Captures system audio (Zoom call)
3. Transcribes and analyzes locally
4. Sends whispers to your headphones

**Tech Stack:**
- Electron app
- Local audio capture
- OpenAI API for transcription/analysis
- Text-to-speech for whispers

**Cost:**
- Software: Free (custom build)
- OpenAI API: ~$0.10-0.30 per session

---

### **Option 3: Vapi Integration (Fastest to Deploy)**

**How It Works:**
1. Vapi AI joins Zoom as participant
2. Configured with compliance rules
3. Monitors conversation
4. Sends alerts via separate phone line to your headphones

**Tech Stack:**
- Vapi.ai (already have account)
- Custom compliance prompts
- Phone line for whispers

**Cost:**
- Vapi: ~$0.05-0.10 per minute
- ~$3-6 per 1-hour session

---

## 🚀 **RECOMMENDED APPROACH:**

**Phase 1: Quick Deploy (This Week)**
- Use Vapi integration
- Configure compliance rules
- Test with practice sessions
- **You're protected immediately!**

**Phase 2: Custom Build (Next Month)**
- Build Zoom bot integration
- More sophisticated analysis
- Better whisper system
- Lower cost per session

## 🎯 **CONTEXT ENGINE:**

### **What AI Whispers During Session:**

```javascript
const contextWhispers = {
  // Opening (First 2 minutes)
  opening: [
    "💡 Last session: [summary]",
    "📅 Important: [upcoming date]",
    "🎯 Current goal: [goal]",
    "⚠️ Alert: [critical item]"
  ],

    "⚠️ Compliance: [alert]",
    "✅ Good! Evidence-based approach"
  ],
  
  // Closing (Last 5 minutes)
  closing: [
    "📝 Action items to confirm: [list]",

    "✅ Session checklist: [items]"
  ]
};
```

## 🔒 **PRIVACY & SECURITY:**

### **Requirements:**
- ✅ HIPAA compliant transcription
- ✅ Encrypted audio transmission
- ✅ Secure storage of session data

- ✅ Data retention policies

### **Consent Template:**
```
"For quality assurance and to ensure I provide you with the best 
evidence-based guidance, our sessions are monitored by an AI system 
that helps me stay current with research and maintain professional 
standards. All data is encrypted and HIPAA compliant. Do I have your 
permission to proceed?"
```

---

## ✅ **SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

**System is working when:**
1. ✅ AI detects and alerts on 100% of compliance violations
2. ✅ Crisis detection triggers within 3 seconds
3. ✅ Context reminders are accurate and timely
4. ✅ Whispers are clear and don't distract from session
5. ✅ You feel confident and protected
6. ✅ Clients receive safe, effective coaching

---

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS:**

1. **Choose implementation approach** (Vapi quick deploy recommended)
2. **Configure compliance rules**
3. **Test with practice sessions**
4. **Get client consent template**
5. **Go live with real clients**
