- "Uh, remind me what we talked about last time?"
- "How's your... um... child doing?"
- "What was their name again?"
- **CLIENT FEELS:** Forgotten, unimportant

### **With Dashboard:**
- "Hi Sarah! How has Alex's sleep been? Did the magnesium help?"
- "I see Alex's birthday is tomorrow - that's so exciting!"
- "Last time you mentioned feeling overwhelmed. How are you doing this week?"
- **CLIENT FEELS:** Seen, remembered, cared for

**THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD AND GREAT COACHING!** 🔥
